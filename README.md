# Neural-Style-Transfer

Gatys et al. proposed the usage of Deep Neural Networks for artistic style transfer. In this repository I am going to demonstrate an implementation of the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style", which conceptualizes the neural style transfer. I came across the term for the first time when I was doing the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng and I was eager to try this out.
