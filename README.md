# Neural-Style-Transfer

Gatys et al. proposed the usage of Deep Neural Networks for artistic style transfer. In this repository I am going to demonstrate an implementation of the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style", which conceptualizes the neural style transfer. I came across the term for the first time when I was doing the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng and I was eager to try this out. 

Link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf

Above is the architecture of the VGG-19 network that was used in this implementation.

I have done this back in 2021, and by this time there might have been some models developed which are optimized better.
